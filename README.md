# Why This ?
TagUI (reference: https://github.com/kelaberetiv/TagUI) is very powerful program which use native language for web-scraping and RPA (Robotic Process Automation), but at the begin it could be a bit tricky to find and remember all commands. Then I built this tool to simplify and accelerate coding. Enjoy!

- Install AutoHotKey : https://autohotkey.com/
- Open Editor of your choice (Notepad++ is great)
- save and launch Tagui-Writer1.03.ahk

# Why This ?
Capture screen shots for Visual automation (Tagui - Sikuli) is time-consuming. Then this tool could help you increase your bot coding productivity.

Use screenshots in TagUI - Sikuli integration, to identify web elements and desktop user interface elements..., i.e.:
click image.png
